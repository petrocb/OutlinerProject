# OutlinerProject
Project to great a task outliner / planner using a tree like structure

The project uses Java Swing to build the GUI and JTree for the task structure. The code is built using a version of the MVC structure. I combined the View and Controller by using a anonymous classes which helped simplify the code. I also used recursion to move the tasks around with the arrow buttons. When a task is completed the text for that task turns green, this functionality was no implemented with Java swing components "out of the box", to do this I had to use a super class.

Overall this projects demonstrates some of my programming abilities like developing easy to read code and the use of more challenging techniques like Super Classes
